# Speech Recognition Inference & Evaluation Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a complete Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) inference and evaluation pipeline using a pretrained speech recognition model from Hugging Face. The pipeline loads a publicly available speech dataset, performs transcription using a pretrained Wav2Vec2 model, evaluates the predictions using standard ASR metrics, and generates reproducible outputs.

The project was developed as part of an ML Internship assignment to demonstrate understanding of speech recognition models, Hugging Face integration, inference pipelines, and evaluation methodologies.

---

## Model

**Model:** `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h`

The model is a pretrained Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based Automatic Speech Recognition model available on Hugging Face.

---

## Dataset

**Dataset:** LibriSpeech Test-Clean

The LibriSpeech dataset is a publicly available English speech corpus containing high-quality read speech derived from audiobooks.

For this project, 50 audio samples from the Test-Clean split were used for inference and evaluation.
